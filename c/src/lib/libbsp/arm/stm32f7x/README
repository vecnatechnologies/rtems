Tested with STM32F7-Discovery evaluation board.

This BSP is built on top the STM Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) code
freely distributed as part of STM32FCube distributions.  

It can be downloaded at

    www.st.com/stm32cube

The BSP can be configured for other STM32F7 series processors by using the 
configure.ac mechanism to specify different clocks and peripherals. 

Use the console-config.c to specify the pins and uart options for the console uart.
Use the uart-config.c to specify the pins and uart options for non-console uarts.

This BSP will initialize the external SDRAM that is part of the STM32F7-Discovery
board.  The BSP linker command will use the SDRAM only for heap memory only.  
The .bss and .data sections will be located in the internal SRAM. Change the 
linkcmds.stm32fx file to move other regions into the SDRAM.
