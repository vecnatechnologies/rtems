Tested with STM32F4-Discovery evaluation board.

This BSP is built on top the STM Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) code
freely distributed as part of STM32FCube distributions.  

The BSP can be configured for other STM32F4 series processors by using the 
configure.ac to specify different clocks and peripherals.

Use the console-config.c to specify the pins and uart options for the console uart.
Use the uart-config.c to specify the pins and uart options for non-console uarts.
